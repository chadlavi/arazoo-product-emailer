# Arazoo Product Email Compiler

a little script to make it easier for our marketing team to put together newsletter content at [Arazoo](https://arazoo.com).

### TO USE:

```cd product-hunt
./product-hunt.sh```

and follow the prompts. Asks for product name, image URL, and a category for all products in the email. Result is a block of HTML that can be pasted into MailChimp.

Note: this script is macOS-specific (esp. as regards the `open` and `pbcopy` commands)
